\title{Convert a set of predicted and actual activity transitions to an object that
can be analyzed}
\usage{
get_transition_info(predictions, references, window_size = 1, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{predictions}{A dummy-coded vector of predicted transitions (1)
interspersed with non-transitions (0)}

\item{references}{A dummy-coded vector of actual (i.e., reference)
transitions (1) interspersed with non-transitions (0)}

\item{window_size}{The maximum number of indices that are allowed to separate
a predicted and reference transition, before the two are considered
incompatible}

\item{...}{additional arguments passed to or from methods, not currently used}
}
\value{
an object of class \code{transition} that contains necessary
  information for evaluating the effectiveness of the predictions.
