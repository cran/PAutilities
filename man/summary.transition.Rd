\description{
Evaluate the effectiveness of predicted transitions for an object of class
\code{transition}

When predicting activity transitions, the behavior of the predictor is not
known a priori. It may predict too many or too few transitions, and its
"intent" is also unknown. Therefore, some method is necessary in order to
determine which predictions (if any) should be taken to correspond to a
reference transition. There should also be a record of false positives and
false negatives. The problem is treated as an instance of the college
admissions problem, wherein both parties give their preferences for who they
would like to be matched with, and a stable arrangement is sought. This
function supports the overall goal by assigning the preferences based on the
temporal proximity of predicted and actual transitions. Preferences beyond a
specified \code{window_size} are not allowed.
